    <p>Background</p>
    <p>  Many studies about NIF-effects have not found a correlation between luminance and non-visual effects (NIF-effects), like acute alertness. It is suspected that the lacking aspect of vertical illuminance and field of vision could be the cause of the distorted data in the stuies. The retinal ganglion cells are said to be not equally distributed in the eye and arenâ€™t equaly as sensitive in the whole eye. There has been a developement of programs that standardize the test data, so that the new quantifiable data can be expected to deliver more coherent results. This web-app makes those accesible through the browser.              </p>
